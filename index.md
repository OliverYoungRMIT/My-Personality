### Personality

I have included three different tests that represent me personally as well as some explanation for them.

### Myers–Briggs Type Indicator

### What do the results of these tests mean for you?

These results show a clear tendency towards introversion and emotional thinking. I think many people confuse this with a dislike of people, when that is not true. I enjoy being around people greatly, I often feel better being around friends than being alone, however it takes me a long time to open up to people and become comfortable with them

### How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?

Introversion and agreeableness is unfortunately not a desirable trait in most groups. I tend to sit in the corner and do my work (often in bursts of energy) which can often make me appear unreliable and not dependable. Agreeableness too, may seem like a good trait in a group but challenging ideas is the cornerstone of innovation.

### How should you take this into account when forming a team?

Despite the results, I enjoy working with people in groups, exposure is the best way for me to learn how to work in a group and have my ideas heard and understood, in saying that though, I do believe that leading a team – at least at this stage – would be a mistake, I would rather let somebody else take charge, however I personally believe I should speak up more as I have a tendency to become disillusioned due to my ideas not being heard.
